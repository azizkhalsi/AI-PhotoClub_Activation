#2 Any thoughts on the DxO offer for your members?

Hello {{First name}} 

I just wanted to follow up on my previous message about offering your photography club, {{Company name}}, an exclusive discount on all new DxO software, including PhotoLab and Nik Collection.

We'd still love to set this up for your members — it's an opportunity to give them access to powerful creative tools, and we make the process simple on your end.

If you're interested or have any questions, I'm happy to help!

Best regards,
