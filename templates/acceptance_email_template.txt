#3 DxO Partnership Proposal – 20% Off for Your Members

Hello {{First name}} 

I hope you're doing well, and thank you again for your previous reply. We'd love to offer your photography club {{Company name}} an exclusive 20% discount on all new DxO software licenses (excluding upgrades):

• DxO PhotoLab – A professional-grade RAW photo editor featuring DeepPRIME noise reduction technologies, U Point™ local adjustments, and best-in-class optical corrections.

• Nik Collection – 7 powerful creative plug-ins to stylize your images and enhance your workflow in Photoshop, Lightroom, Photolab, Affinity Photo more or as standalone tools.

• DxO PureRAW – Advanced RAW pre-processing that dramatically improves image quality before editing, thanks to AI-driven denoising and unmatched lens corrections, which works seamlessly with Lightroom and other editors.

• DxO FilmPack – Authentic analog film styles recreated with vintage effects, color rendering, and grain simulations.

• DxO ViewPoint – Essential geometry correction tools to fix distortion, perspective issues, and volume deformation, especially in wide-angle shots.

How it works:

We've set up a simple online form that members can fill out with their name and email. Once submitted, they'll instantly receive their unique discount code — both on-screen and by email.

We're also happy to provide your club with free licenses for up to two club computers, ideal for demos, workshops, or general club use.

If it's helpful, I'd be glad to organize a short Zoom session to introduce the software to your team or members.

Let me know if you'd like me to send you the custom link and flyer to share with your group. And out of curiosity — what kind of photography does your club focus on?

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
