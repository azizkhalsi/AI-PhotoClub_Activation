PERSONALIZATION ANGLE:
APS is Australia’s only FIAP-affiliated body and runs a structured honours system that serious photographers use to gain internationally recognised letters after their name. A personalised email that acknowledges a prospect’s interest in gaining formal distinctions (e.g., “working toward your AAPS or FIAP honours”) or in representing Australia at international biennials would resonate strongly.",0.01527,0.01,0.02527,2025-07-10T09:43:31.309363,2025-08-09T09:43:31.309363
