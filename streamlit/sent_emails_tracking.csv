Hello {{First name}} 

I hope you're doing well, and thank you again for your previous reply.

With a vibrant community of up to 1,600 members and a well-organized leadership team, your club’s multi-channel communication approach—including e-News, Facebook, and recorded webinars—provides an excellent platform for promoting the DxO discount code and benefits.

• DxO PhotoLab – A professional-grade RAW photo editor featuring DeepPRIME noise reduction technologies, U Point™ local adjustments, and best-in-class optical corrections.

• Nik Collection – 7 powerful creative plug-ins to stylize your images and enhance your workflow in Photoshop, Lightroom, Photolab, Affinity Photo more or as standalone tools.

• DxO PureRAW – Advanced RAW pre-processing that dramatically improves image quality before editing, thanks to AI-driven denoising and unmatched lens corrections, which works seamlessly with Lightroom and other editors.

• DxO FilmPack – Authentic analog film styles recreated with vintage effects, color rendering, and grain simulations.

• DxO ViewPoint – Essential geometry correction tools to fix distortion, perspective issues, and volume deformation, especially in wide-angle shots.

How it works:

We've set up a simple online form that members can fill out with their name and email. Once submitted, they'll instantly receive their unique discount code — both on-screen and by email.

We're also happy to provide your club with free licenses for up to two club computers, ideal for demos, workshops, or general club use.
