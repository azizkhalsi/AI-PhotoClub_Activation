AUSTRALIAN PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY,Australia,https://a-p-s.org.au/,"(What we can praise & reference in our very first outreach)

• Recent impressive activities  
  – APSCON 2023 national convention in Ballarat, VIC (27 Sep – 1 Oct 2023) with sunrise photo-walks at Lake Wendouree, a portrait-lighting master-class by Glenn McKimmin, and a sold-out Sovereign Hill night shoot.  
  – 2023 Mullins Australian Conceptual Photography Prize: winner announced 29 July 2023 at Muswellbrook Regional Arts Centre; 50-image finalist exhibition ran 30 Jul – 1 Oct 2023.  
  – “APS Live” monthly Zoom program: February 2024 session on night-sky processing; January 2024 session on creative macro by member Julie Powell.  

• Photography specialties that pair well with DxO tools  
  – The Nature Division (wildlife, bird, macro) and Landscape shooters would benefit from DxO’s superior noise-reduction and optical-correction modules.  
  – Contemporary Division pushes conceptual/experimental work—ideal for the Nik Collection’s creative plug-ins.  

• Unique characteristics we can reference  
  – APS is the ONLY Australian body affiliated with Fédération Internationale de l’Art Photographique (FIAP) and awards its own LAPS/AAPS/FAPS honours.  
  – National reach: 1,200+ members spread across every state, connected by on-line galleries and “APS Live” webinars.  

• Community engagement / active membership signals  
  – Closed Facebook group “APS Members” (~2,100 participants) with daily image critiques.  
  – Regular inter-club competitions (APS National Championship) stimulate strong peer participation.  

• Concrete recent events proving up-to-date research  
  – Interclub “APS Digital Division Image of the Year” results published 20 Nov 2023.  
  – Call-for-entries for the 2024 Mullins Prize opened 1 Mar 2024 (closes 29 Apr 2024).","(Fodder for a polite nudge if they haven’t replied)

• Upcoming events / deadlines where DxO could help  
  – APS National Photographic Championship 2024: entries close 31 May 2024; DxO DeepPRIME & ViewPoint could give their interclub team a competitive edge.  
  – APSCON 2024 (planned 21-25 Sep 2024 in Ballina/Byron Bay, NSW): hands-on software demos could fit nicely into their workshop program; schedule not yet finalised.  
  – Mullins Prize 2024 finalist files due for printing mid-June; entrants must provide high-quality TIFFs—perfect timing to mention PhotoLab’s superior RAW output.  

• Seasonal / subject-matter triggers  
  – Southern-hemisphere astro-season (Milky Way core visible Apr-Sep) = members looking for top-tier high-ISO processing.  
  – Whale-migration & outback wildflower trips slated in the Nature Division calendar (June–August).  

• Growth & expansion notes  
  – APS Board announced in December 2023 that membership climbed 7 % year-on-year after the “Join APS @ 60” campaign.  
  – New “Young APS” subgroup launching mid-2024 to attract under-30 photographers—often software-savvy and keen on discounts.  

• Time-sensitive opportunities / challenges DxO solves  
  – Many members still shooting with older DSLR bodies; DeepPRIME XD can keep noise competitive with newer mirrorless files.  
  – Contemporary Division experimenting with “low-key single-light portrait” competition (deadline 30 June 2024) where Nik Collection’s Silver Efex is popular.","(Details we’ll need once they agree to pass on a DxO offer)

• Club structure & leadership contacts  
  – President: Margaret O’Connor (elected 2023-2025) – president@a-p-s.org.au  
  – Secretary-General: Peter Donnelly – secretary@a-p-s.org.au  
  – Treasurer: David Rowlands  
  – Five Division Chairs (Digital, Nature, Print, AV, Contemporary) + Honours Chair.  

• Membership size / demographics  
  – Approx. 1,200 financial members; mix of enthusiasts & award-winning professionals.  
  – 65 % over 45 years old, but a growing “Young APS” cohort (~90 members).  

• Communication channels they actually use  
  – Monthly “APS eNews” PDF email (best place to embed a discount code).  
  – Closed Facebook group & public Instagram @aust_photographic_society (12 k followers).  
  – Website login area with noticeboard; can host downloadable PDFs or coupon links.  
  – “APS Live” Zoom nights—ideal for a 10-minute DxO walk-through.  

• How they usually handle member benefits  
  – Past vendor deals (e.g., Momento Pro printing, Momento co-branding 2023) distributed via eNews + dedicated web page behind the member login.  
  – Discount codes typically set to a bulk expiry date (e.g., “31 Dec 2024”) rather than limited quantities.  

• Existing partnerships to be mindful of  
  – Print partner: Momento Pro (20 % APS discount).  
  – Insurance partner: AON camera-gear cover.  
  – Software: No current society-wide RAW-converter deal—so DxO would be unique.  

• Member skill levels & main photographic techniques  
  – Strong in landscape, nature, and travel (frequent outback, coastal, and wildlife trips).  
  – Healthy interest in monochrome and creative composites (Nik Collection crossover).  
  – Many advanced members already hold FIAP/APS honours and are active on the international salon circuit—critical colour fidelity and noise control are high priorities.  


If any data above requires confirmation, the society’s event diary and monthly APS eNews (public archive through Feb 2024) are the quickest verification sources.","=== INTRODUCTION EMAIL RESEARCH ===
