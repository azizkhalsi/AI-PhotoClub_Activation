Hello 

I hope the photographers at AUSTRALIAN PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY are enjoying a creative season.

I’m Killian, part of the Partnerships team at DxO Labs, the creators of award-winning photo editing software like DxO PhotoLab and Nik Collection. 

I read about the Australian Photographic Society’s vibrant community and their innovative flagship events like APSCON 2024 and the Mullins Australian Conceptual Photography Prize. I believe DxO's advanced editing tools can help your members elevate their creative visions and showcase their work to even greater effect.

We're offering an exclusive discount on all new DxO software for members of selected photography clubs, and I'd love to extend this offer to your group. 

No strings attached — just a simple way to support your members' creative work. Let me know if you'd like the details — I'd be happy to set everything up. 

Best regards,
 
Killian Dare
