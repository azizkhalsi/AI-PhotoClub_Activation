Hello 

I hope the photographers at AUSTRALIAN PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY are enjoying a creative season.

I’m Killian, part of the Partnerships team at DxO Labs, the creators of award-winning photo editing software like DxO PhotoLab and Nik Collection. 

I came across the Australian Photographic Society's recent success at APSCON 2023 and the Mullins Conceptual Photography Prize, showcasing your members’ diverse talents.

We're offering an exclusive discount on all new DxO software for members of selected photography clubs, and I'd love to extend this offer to your group. 

No strings attached — just a simple way to support your members' creative work. Let me know if you'd like the details — I'd be happy to set everything up.
